The goal of this project is to identify persons of interest for potentially having committed
fraud by analyzing characteristics of the Enron email database . Machine learning, particularly supervised learning techniques, is useful in this effort because it can effectively explore patterns within the data and attempt to correlate these patterns with expected outcomes.

Documentation for this analysis is available here:
